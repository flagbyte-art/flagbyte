# FlagByte — Pixel Flags as Net Art

One pixel per day for 365 days. The Palestinian flag in slow construction. For a deeper explanation of the artistic vision behind this project, see the [Concept](docs/concept.md).


## Rules
- **1 Instagram post per day (365 total), scheduled via Meta Business Suite** (official Meta tool).
- Fixed grid & palette defined at the start.
- Consistent output size (1080×1080 or 1080×1350) and sRGB color profile.
- Minimal captions; optional alt text for accessibility.
- No commentary on current events — this is an image–time experiment.

## Repositories
- `flagbyte` — docs & logs
- `flagbyte-instagram-assets` — source files & final exports
- `flagbyte-automation` — scripts

## Structure
- `docs/` — concept, grid specs, palette  
- `logs/` — posting log  
- `references/` — artists, tools

## Posting workflow
1. Prepare batch of exports → `/export/day_XXX.png`.  
2. Use automation scripts to generate captions (`Day X/365. One pixel per day.`).  
3. Upload batch into **Meta Business Suite Planner**.  
4. Schedule posts → 1 per day, covering at least 30 days ahead.  
5. Monitor log updates in `logs/posting-log.md`.

## Previews

## About

I am Alberto, an independent Italian videomaker in my mid-30s.  
This project is entirely the result of my persistence and of an inexhaustible, restless curiosity about everything that escapes certainty and the definition of reality.  
It is the first experiment of this scale in my life, presented as an open net-art work.
