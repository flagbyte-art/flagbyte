# Concept

FlagByte is a long-form net art experiment: **one pixel per day for 365 days**, slowly constructing the Palestinian flag.

At its core, the project questions the relationship between **image, time, and meaning**. The time of art is not the time of reality. While reality is shaped by urgency, acceleration, and the demand for immediacy, art insists on its own temporality — slower, deliberate, resistant to pressure. FlagByte is also an experiment on how the **media system bends our perception of urgency**. News cycles dictate what feels immediate and what is forgotten; events acquire importance or lose it based on how their temporality is framed. By stretching the creation of a single image across an entire year, the project mirrors and critiques this dynamic: the flag emerges not as breaking news, but as a patient accumulation of gestures.

**Constraints**
- Fixed grid and color palette defined on day 1.  
- Output format: 1080×1080 or 1080×1350, sRGB.  
- Minimal captions; optional alt text for accessibility.  
- Posting is automated via Meta Business Suite (1 post/day).  

**Why**
The work investigates how meaning is constructed not in the instant but through repetition and delay. The flag becomes not a symbol of urgency but a study in persistence — an image built pixel by pixel, day after day, in tension with the rhythm of media time.

**Archive**
- Preview images live in this repository.  
- Full source and exports will be archived separately.  
- A public mini-site will mirror progress.
